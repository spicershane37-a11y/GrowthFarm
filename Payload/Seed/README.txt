The Death Star — Quick Start

1) Launch The Death Star from your Desktop or Start Menu.
2) In the KYBER CHAMBER grid, paste your leads under the header row:
   Email, First Name, Last Name, Company, Industry, Phone, Address, City, State, Reviews, Website
3) Make sure the "Industry" column is filled in (e.g. Butcher, Farm, Orchard).
   - The app uses this to select the right email template.
4) Click “Fire the Death Star” to create Outlook drafts.
   - Drafts will appear in Outlook → Drafts → Order 66.
5) Use the Templates tab to edit your subject lines and body text if you want.
6) Track replies in the Results tab by marking them Green (good), Gray (neutral), or Red (negative).

User data is saved in:
%USERPROFILE%\DeathStarApp
- kybercrystals.csv (your leads)
- templates.ini (your email templates)
- results.csv (your reply tracking)
- annihilated_planets.txt (fingerprints of already-drafted leads)

Tips:
- To start fresh, delete annihilated_planets.txt.
- To change presets, edit templates.ini.
- Always keep one header row in kybercrystals.csv before pasting new leads.
